# kos-mode

This is an Emacs major mode for editing KerboScript files. KerboScript is the language used by
the popular Kerbal Space Program scripting mod kOS. See the [KerboScript and kOS documentation](https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS)
for more information.

At the moment, this is a fairly spartan major mode, but its features include syntax highlighting
(including of all global variables and builtin functions I know of, and with customizable font faces),
as well as auto-indentation.
